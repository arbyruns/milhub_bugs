Bugs for MilHub App
# How do I report a bug?

To create a report, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is super fast (and free) to do.

Then, go to the “Issues” tab at the top, then select “New Issue” and simply fill in the form. Please make sure you include as much of the requested information as possible, it helps me out a ton!

# Why do I need to sign up for an account here?

GitHub's an awesome site that's really well-suited for bug tracking. It'll keep things more organized than having bug bug discussions & feature requests. Having to sign up for an account is super quick though and helps cut down on spam, so it's worth it, trust me! Sign Up
